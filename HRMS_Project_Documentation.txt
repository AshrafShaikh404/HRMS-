## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 What is HRMS?

A Human Resource Management System is a centralized digital platform that enables organizations to efficiently manage all HR-related processes and employee information in one place, replacing manual spreadsheets and paper-based systems.

### 2.2 Problem Statement

**Current Challenges (Manual System):**
- Attendance tracking done manually on paper or Excel spreadsheets → error-prone
- Leave requests managed via email → no audit trail
- Payroll calculations are time-consuming and prone to mistakes

- No centralized employee database → data redundancy
- Reports generation is manual and slow

### 2.3 Proposed Solution

An integrated HRMS application with:
- Digital attendance tracking with automated reporting
- Streamlined leave approval workflow
- Automated payroll calculation based on attendance
- Centralized employee database with document management
- Role-based access for Admin, HR, and Employees
- Real-time dashboards and analytics

### 6.3 Authentication & Authorization Flow

```
1. User logs in with email + password
   ↓
2. Backend verifies credentials and checks against users collection
   ↓
3. Password matched → Generate JWT token with role embedded
   ↓
4. Send token to frontend
   ↓
5. Frontend stores token in localStorage and redirects to dashboard
   ↓
6. Every API request includes Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ↓
7. Backend middleware extracts token, verifies signature, checks role
   ↓
8. If valid → Allow access; If invalid → Return 401/403
```

### 10.3 Data Flow and State Management

#### Attendance State Flow

```
Employee Marks Check-In
    ↓
✓ Validate (working hours, not already checked in today)
    ↓
Create Attendance Record (checkInTime set)
    ↓
Response: "Checked In Successfully at 09:15 AM"
    ↓
[Later] Employee Marks Check-Out
    ↓
✓ Validate (checked in today, checkout after check-in)
    ↓
Update Attendance Record (checkOutTime set, workedHours calculated)
    ↓
Status auto-set based on workedHours
    ↓
Response: "Checked Out Successfully. Worked: 9.5 hours"
```

#### Leave State Flow

```
Employee Applies Leave
    ↓
✓ Validate (dates, leave balance, overlapping leaves)
    ↓
Create Leave Record (status: "pending")
    ↓
Notification to HR/Admin
    ↓
[HR Reviews]
    ├─→ Approve: Update status → "approved", Update Employee.leaveBalance
    │
    └─→ Reject: Update status → "rejected", Add rejectionReason
    ↓
Mark Attendance Records in date range as "leave"
    ↓
Employee receives notification
```

#### Payroll State Flow

```
HR Initiates Payroll Generation for Month M
    ↓
System fetches all active employees
    ↓
For each employee:
  ├─ Fetch Attendance records for Month M
  ├─ Calculate presentDays, absentDays, paidLeaves, unpaidLeaves
  ├─ Fetch Salary from Employee record
  ├─ Calculate netSalary formula
  ├─ Create Payroll record (status: "generated")
    ↓
Generate payroll for all employees (status: "generated")
    ↓
Payroll visible to HR for review/corrections
    ↓
[HR Approves]
    ├─ Status changes to "approved"
    │
    └─ (Optional) Status changes to "released" → Ready for payment
    ↓
Employee can download payslip in "approved" or "released" status

describe('Payroll Calculation', () => {
  test('Should calculate net salary correctly', () => {
    const basic = 50000;
    const workingDays = 21;
    const payableDays = 20;
    const expectedGross = 47619.05;
    
    const gross = (basic * payableDays) / workingDays;
    expect(Math.round(gross * 100) / 100).toBe(expectedGross);
  });
  
  test('Should handle leave balance updates', () => {
    const initialBalance = 12;
    const leaveTaken = 3;
    const expectedBalance = 9;
    
    const finalBalance = initialBalance - leaveTaken;
    expect(finalBalance).toBe(expectedBalance);
  });
});

// Authentication test
describe('Authentication', () => {
  test('Should hash password securely', async () => {
    const password = 'TestPass123';
    const hashed = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
    expect(hashed).not.toBe(password);
    const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, hashed);
    expect(isMatch).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### 14.2 Integration Testing

**Focus:** Module interactions, API workflows, database operations

**Examples:**
```javascript
// Leave workflow integration test
describe('Leave Management Workflow', () => {
  test('Should complete leave approval workflow', async () => {
    // 1. Employee applies for leave
    const leaveApp = await Leave.create({
      employeeId: 'emp123',
      leaveType: 'casual',
      fromDate: '2024-02-10',
      toDate: '2024-02-12',
      numberOfDays: 3,
      status: 'pending'
    });
    
    // 2. HR approves leave
    leaveApp.status = 'approved';
    await leaveApp.save();
    
    // 3. Leave balance updates
    const employee = await Employee.findById('emp123');
    expect(employee.leaveBalance.casualLeave).toBe(9); // 12 - 3
    
    // 4. Attendance marked as leave
    const attendance = await Attendance.find({
      employeeId: 'emp123',
      date: { $gte: '2024-02-10', $lte: '2024-02-12' }
    });
    attendance.forEach(att => {
      expect(att.status).toBe('leave');
    });
  });
});

// Payroll generation integration test
describe('Payroll Generation', () => {
  test('Should generate payroll for all employees with correct calculations', async () => {
    await Payroll.generateForMonth(1, 2024);
    
    const payrolls = await Payroll.find({ month: 1, year: 2024 });
    expect(payrolls.length).toBe(250); // All active employees
    
    payrolls.forEach(payroll => {
      expect(payroll.netSalary).toBeGreaterThan(0);
      expect(payroll.status).toBe('generated');
    });
  });
});
```

### 14.3 System/End-to-End Testing

   ✓ System shows appropriate error messages

### 14.4 Performance Testing

**Metrics to Measure:**
- API response time (target: < 500ms for typical queries)
- Dashboard load time (target: < 2 seconds)
- Report generation time (target: < 5 seconds)
- Concurrent user support (target: 50+ users)

**Load Testing:**
```javascript
// Simulate 50 concurrent API requests
const loadTest = async () => {
  const startTime = Date.now();
  const requests = Array(50).fill().map(() => 
    axios.get('/api/v1/employees?page=1&limit=20')
  );
  
  const responses = await Promise.all(requests);
  const endTime = Date.now();
  
  const avgResponseTime = (endTime - startTime) / 50;
